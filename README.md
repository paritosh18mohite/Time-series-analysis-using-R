This research develops and compares different models to forecast new product sales data with increasing sales trend and multiple predictor inputs. To forecast a future total quarterly turnover and volume of sales in wholesale and retail trade of food, beverages, and tobacco for all eurozone countries trend, we developed and evaluated multiple time series forecasting methods, including Exponential Smoothing model, Holtâ€™s Linear model, ARIMA model, and SARIMA. Furthermore, we created multiple Causal Factor Forecasting models to incorporate various dependent input factors and seasonality factors, to further reduce forecasting error.
